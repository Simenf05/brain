# Memory hierarchy
The memory in a computer uses a structure much like a pyramid, this is called the memory hierarchy. The priciple is that we have both fast and small memory and slow and big memory. For each size and speed we have different layers, and we walk through these layers in an attempt to find the address we are looking for. 
## SRAM
This is the fastest type of memory, and it is located within the [[CPU]]. This makes it the fastest while also being the smallest. The name SRAM comes from static RAM, and this is because it, unlike DRAM, persists. SRAM is made up with a bunch of latches and is therefore very fast, but the size has to be small if it is to be fast.
## DRAM
DRAM is dynamic ram, and it is called dynamic because it has to update the values itself to persist them. DRAM is cheaper in size, but also slower. DRAM is used in the outer parts of the CPU.
