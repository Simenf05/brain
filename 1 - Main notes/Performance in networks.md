### 4 main ways of delay in packet switches

1. Processing delay
	- Caused by checking for bit errors
	- And for determining the output link
2. Queuing delay
	- Time to wait for other packets
3. Transmission delay
	- Packet length / transmission rate 
	- L / R
4. Propagation delay
	- The time it takes to send the packet from sender to receiver
	- Bepends on physical media
	- length / speed
