#### Backlog
The backlog is the tasks from the last sprint and it is prioritized by the project owner. The team will expand this to concrete tasks. 

#### Sprint 
A sprint is a short period of work days (2 weeks) where the team works on the tasks, and at the end the goal is to have a shippable product.
