# Simple mail transfer protocol
The email system consists of three main components:
- User agents 
- Mail servers
- SMTP
#### User agents
This is used for writing emails and reading emails. The emails is still stored on the server but you use the agents locally to make changes to the emails. 

#### Mail server
The mail server is where all the email are stored. They are stored in a mailbox, and the server has a mailbox for each user. The server also has a queue for emails waiting to be sent. 

#### SMTP
The final piece of the puzzle is smtp, and it is used to send emails between clients and servers. The user agent will use smtp to send a email to the server, but the servers also use it to send the mails in between each other.
