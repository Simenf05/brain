# Pipelined computer architecture

Pipelining in the computer architecture is a way of increasing throughput of the processor. This is done by allowing the processor work on multiple parts/*stages* of the instructions in parallel. Completing a single instruction may not increase in speed, but when you have a big amount of instructions it will increase drastically. 


## Hazards
There is situations where the pipeline cannot execute two instructions at the same time in the pipeline, these scenarios are called hazards. We have three types of hazards. 
### Structural hazards


### Data hazards
### Control hazards
