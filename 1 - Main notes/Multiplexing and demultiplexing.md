# Multiplexing and demultiplexing

Multiplexing is the operation of taking all the messages sent from each of the different sockets on the host and uniting them to be given to the [[networking layer]]. Demultiplexing is the opposite operation where the the [[Transport layer|transport layer]] receives segments from the [[networking layer]] and has to read the headers and distribute the segments to the different sockets on the host.
