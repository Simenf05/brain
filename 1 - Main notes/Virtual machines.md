# Virtual machines
Virtual machines is a way for the computer to run multiple [[Operating System|operating systems]] on the same hardware at the same time. To enable this you run another privileged [[process]] that manages the two processes. This process is called the Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) or hypervisor. Hypervisors has to have access to both kernel mode and user mode on the [[Central Processing Unit|CPU]].
