During the first deliverable I started with creating the directory structure, I did this  with Kristoffer while the others did tasks like writing about AI and creating user stories. When the directory structure was completed I moved on to creating the first version of persistence. This is the `JsonFileWriter` class and served as the base for writing to json file in our project.
