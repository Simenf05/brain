### 1. deliverable
During the first deliverable, I started with creating the directory structure, I did this  with Kristoffer while the others did tasks like writing about AI and creating user stories. When the directory structure was completed I moved on to creating the first version of persistence. This is the `JsonFileWriter` class and served as the base for writing to json file in our project. 
When we started work on the second deliverable, I worked with Lukas on testing the persistence from the first deliverable. I also worked with Kristoffer on modularization of the entire project. To finish up the deliverable I wrote javadoc for persistence and updated readme's to match the current state of the project.
To start of the last deliverable, I yet again I worked with Kristoffer to make the initial endpoints on our spring boot server. After that i created a package diagram for the project, and in the process of this I ended up refactoring the package structure. After this I refactored the voting part of JsonFileWriter and added sorting based on amount of votes to the voting list. I have also done some tests, reviewed pull requests and been designated git help for the group.
